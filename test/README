Simulates a basic phone line

When handset A is picked up, it puts out a dial tone. After 2 seconds, it starts ringing the remote end.

When both sides pick up, it connects.

When either side hangs up, it disconnects.

This was designed to fool two modems into thinking they're connected through a real phone line.
